# Deep-Learning--project2
AI-based Question Answering system using BERT + FAISS

## Overview
This project builds an intelligent question-answering system that can retrieve the most relevant answer from a dataset based on user queries. It combines the power of BERT for semantic understanding and FAISS for fast and efficient similarity search.

## Key Features
- Converts questions and answers into dense vector representations using BERT.
- Indexes answer vectors using FAISS for fast retrieval.
- Computes semantic similarity to fetch the best-matching answer to any input query.
- Scalable solution for QA over large datasets or document bases.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- BERT (Transformers)
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- Streamlit (for optional UI)

## Use Case
Can be used in chatbots, customer support systems, educational QA apps, or internal knowledge bases to provide instant and relevantÂ answers.
